The intentions.py file is a JSON file containing a partial number of users intentions which can be asked by the web visitor.It contains the tag of the intention,pattern and the intended response.
The training.py file contains the loading of the JSON file to train and enhance the neural network of the machine learning model I developed though I ran into a challenge of understanding the neural network well but I managed to go through.The model
iis able to understand the binaries (1s and 0s) in which I took a lot of time changing the words from the JSON file into binaries.Probably  I tried.
The chatbot.py contains the chatbot model itself which is 87.97% functional but I think this is due to the inadequate data in the JSON file since I supplied a partial set of data to kick on the bigger development stage  since I had to quench my thirst for machine learning asap.
